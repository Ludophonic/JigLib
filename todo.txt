use tTransform instead of separate pos/orientation

maybe use quaternion

share data between primitives in collision skin

use terminology of predicted transforms rather than new/old

don't use float for time in physics system

check elasticity - seems broken for accumulated

proper contact caching

check ballistic penetration resolution - fails when maxVelMag is large....

Form collision islands

preprocess getting called twice? (during collision even if n coll steps = 0)
